# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/gkZCQtH) instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to the guidebot codebase, feel free to fork the repository and submit a

is a great boon to your development process.

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **master** branch
